# Clothes pin probability distribution
## Introduction
N clothes pins with a width of 2Ïƒ, a string of length L. The clothes pins can not overlap and must be uniformly distributed over the string.

## Objective
Obtain the aproximate probability distribution of clothes pin positions in the ensemble of valid configurations.


## Theoretical result
The goal distribution should look like the following:

## My solution
I start placing the clothes pins evenly spaced along the string. Then move one by one every clothes pin a distance between their adjacent clothes pin and make them bounce if they colide.
